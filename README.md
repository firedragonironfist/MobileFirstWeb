## Issues

1. **Image Responsiveness in Chrome:**
   - To check the image responsiveness, please use Firefox browser. Chrome may have some caching issues that affect how the images are displayed. In Firefox, you should see the responsive behavior as intended.

2. **Alert Dropdown for Geolocation in Chrome:**
   - When you click the "Get My Location" button to retrieve the user's location, the information is displayed in an alert window.
   - Please use Chrome to test this feature, as in Firefox, the alert window does not appear due to browser-specific behavior. In Chrome, you will see an alert message that mentions the user's location details.
